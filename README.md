# Guardian Angel
## 💡 Inspiration
We noticed the rapid increase of bullying against teens, but especially teens that are members of the BIPOC, AAPI, and/or LGBTQ+ community. With the spike of hate against these communities, there was not an increase in moderation of hate speech and cyberbullying on online platforms such as Discord. Recently, Khloe Kardashian, had her team scrub the internet of the unedited photo of herself. Twitter admin/moderators were particularly swift in helping Khloe’s team remove her photo from the platform, but when it comes to removing hate speech Twitter and other online/social media platforms take their sweet time.

## 💻 What it does
Guardian Angel is a Discord bot that can join servers and detect if the messages are toxic, flirtatious, spam, an insult, or nonsensical. When it finds a message that does fit one of these buckets (i.e. insult) it “reacts” to the message with the respective emoji. You can go back and check to see how many reactions each user has received by typing  “!karma”  in the channel. And if any user sends 3+ of these inappropriate messages, they get kicked or banned from the server

## ⚙️ How we built it
With discord.js and Shell on GitHub. As well as perspective APIs from Google.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
We had to debug the code because the bot didn't detect insulting, toxic, etc. messages. Then we did get it to start detecting it started mixing up the labels, so we had to debug that as well.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing this amazing project in the allotted time despite all the challenges.
Creating a practical and ready-to-use discord bot to help ensure a safe place for members of the BIPOC, AAPI, and LGBTQ+ communities on a widely used platform, discord.

## 📖 What we've learned
We learned how to use and make discord bots.

## ⏭️ What's next for _Guardian Angel_
We want to make it compatible with most if not all social media/online platforms.
We also want to make a web extension version.
